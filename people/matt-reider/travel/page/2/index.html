A market it isn’t. More like a county fair. We were joined by new friends. Thank God Alison is good at making them. Without her we’d be very bored. And thank goodness these befriended friends are fun. Incriminating evidence to follow.
The befriended friends come with kid-friends too. Fun to be had by the lot of us. Grown-up bunny-ear fun, and kid fun on the Autodrom (bumper cars)....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2019-10-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 7, 2019</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Urfahraner Market" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/urfahraner-market/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/d04.jpeg alt style=width:450px;height:296px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>Some Light Reading in Linz</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Linz was Hitler’s favorite town. It’s where he started and where he wanted to end up. Austria’s largest concentration camp, Mathausen, is close by. That’s where the granite was quarried for the Nibelungen bridge. We see it every day.
We knew this about Linz. We talked about it before we moved here. Friends and family asked how that felt. They wondered if there is still anti-semitism here. It’s fine, we said....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2019-09-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 30, 2019</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Some Light Reading in Linz" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/light-reading/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/1_QxVEUex8kOodcO_9FjODLg.jpeg alt style=width:700px;height:486px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>Memories of Vermont</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I am on a work trip this week. Four of us. Visiting a satellite office in Klagenfurt so I can meet the team and join some planning sessions. We took a train here, which lasted five hours and went through the alps — but it was mostly dark and foggy. When the fog lifted, which happened a few times, I compared the countryside to places in America. The mountains look like the rockies — big peaks and spires....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2019-09-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 19, 2019</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Memories of Vermont" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/memories-of-vermont/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/0_cvAPXYQPV4j3iuon.jpeg alt style=width:456px;height:280px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>The Everything Animal</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>We are ahead of ourselves.

But it’s September, not April.

Mercedes benzos. Nice cars. Just rented my second one from the Hertz in downtown Linz. A triple upgrade from the Ford Fiesta, but no rate change. Just €32 a day. That’s how we roll. I rolled it all the way home.
We rent cars to transport things we can’t carry, and to get out of town. Driving around is pretty easy.

Tomorrow will be one week in Linz, Austria. We live in an apartment on Spazenhofstraße, a quiet street on the Postlingberg Tram line. Our building has five ground level apartments, each with two floors, and five balcony apartments along the top.
