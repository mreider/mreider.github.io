First was Long Island to celebrate Marty’s 80th birthday. Second was Vermont to join Rosie and Zach’s wedding. Then Portugal, with #friends4life Schwartzberg clan.
Coronavirus made it bumpy. The guest list for Marty’s birthday was shorter than planned. A particularly important guest, Alison, tested positive and spent the week feeling crappy, at the Stony Brook holiday Inn Express. It was a great party but not the same without her....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-08-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 24, 2022</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Going Viral" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/going-viral/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/praguish.jpeg alt style=width:720px;height:540px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>More than 20 Questions</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Last week we took an American style road trip (🚙) through the Czech Republic. Originally we were thinking about Holland. Also Norway. But we procrastinated and airfares went up. So we decided to drive North.
On the road Like other vacations, this one started by dropping Leo (🐶) at his second home - a beautiful kennel ranch outside of Linz.
Here’s an aerial view:
Nice place right? Leo agrees.

Not sure why. Wasn’t feeling it.
But today I’ll give you a short update.
We’ve experienced some new things. We went skiing on a couple of glaciers. We bought a hyperactive dog named Leo. We visited friends and family in America and then went scuba diving in Costa Rica. In autumn we saw Belgium, then climbed up the Eiffel Tower. Then it was winter again....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-03-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 10, 2022</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to A Year Went By" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/a-year-went-by/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/1_l2i7EqauON04D-pjr9b1gQ-1.jpeg alt style=width:700px;height:525px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>Teamwork in Corfu</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>I learned some important things during our vacation in Corfu. Wasps don’t like smoke. Google maps can tell you to drive in circles. Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving.
The scuba diving bit was learned on this boat in the town of Nisaki, on Corfu’s northeast side. If you look closely you’ll see Chris, the owner of Apollo dive, sitting with my wife and kids.
Chris and his wife Maria led us on five dives in total....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2020-09-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 6, 2020</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Teamwork in Corfu" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/teamwork-in-corfu/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/1_p5W-O_HqQHBXIqS10N-Fsw@2x.jpeg alt style=width:700px;height:525px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>Wasser, Acqua, Voda</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>The Danube flows less than a mile from our house. Once, on a hot day, I peddled to it, took off my shirt, and jumped in. The current was strong. Off I went Eastward towards Vienna. I made it back home in time for dinner.
A few weeks later we drove to a bigger body of water. The Adriatic. Venice.

This makes the kids very happy. I put on some ski gear and rode my bike to work along with dozens of other folks.
Snow fits the scenery. Linz is all in for Christmas. Lights are strung above the streets. Clear lights, globes, stars, and multi-colored spirals.
Linz has three different Christmas markets within a half mile radius. Main square’s market has tasty Glühwein. Volksgarten has classical music, animatronic elves, and a ferris wheel....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2019-12-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 2, 2019</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to It's snowing" href=https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/its-snowing/></a></article><article class=post-entry><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://there-and-back.org/images/matt/travel-blog/Yin_yang.svg.png alt style=width:350px;height:350px></figure><header class=entry-header><h2>Chaos and Order</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>We had special guests last weekend.

Merkur Markt has the most variety. You can find veggie dogs, sushi rolls, and lots of fresh produce. There are also giant home-made gummy bears. Big fan.
