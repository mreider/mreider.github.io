      <description>Summer vacation was a three-part trip. First was Long Island to celebrate Marty&amp;rsquo;s 80th birthday. Second was Vermont to join Rosie and Zach&amp;rsquo;s wedding. Then Portugal, with #friends4life Schwartzberg clan.
Coronavirus made it bumpy. The guest list for Marty&amp;rsquo;s birthday was shorter than planned. A particularly important guest, Alison, tested positive and spent the week feeling crappy, at the Stony Brook holiday Inn Express. It was a great party but not the same without her.</description>

      <description>Last week we took an American style road trip (üöô) through the Czech Republic. Originally we were thinking about Holland. Also Norway. But we procrastinated and airfares went up. So we decided to drive North.
On the road Like other vacations, this one started by dropping Leo (üê∂) at his second home - a beautiful kennel ranch outside of Linz.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an aerial view:
Nice place right? Leo agrees. He&amp;rsquo;s very waggy about it.</description>

      <title>A Year Went By</title>

      <description>I stopped writing over a year ago. Not sure why. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling it.
But today I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a short update.
We&amp;rsquo;ve experienced some new things. We went skiing on a couple of glaciers. We bought a hyperactive dog named Leo. We visited friends and family in America and then went scuba diving in Costa Rica. In autumn we saw Belgium, then climbed up the Eiffel Tower. Then it was winter again.</description>

      <description>I learned some important things during our vacation in Corfu. Wasps don‚Äôt like smoke. Google maps can tell you to drive in circles. Jacques Cousteau invented scuba diving.
The scuba diving bit was learned on this boat in the town of Nisaki, on Corfu‚Äôs northeast side. If you look closely you‚Äôll see Chris, the owner of Apollo dive, sitting with my wife and kids.
Chris and his wife Maria led us on five dives in total.</description>

      <description>The Danube flows less than a mile from our house. Once, on a hot day, I peddled to it, took off my shirt, and jumped in. The current was strong. Off I went Eastward towards Vienna. I made it back home in time for dinner.
A few weeks later we drove to a bigger body of water. The Adriatic. Venice. Home of St. Mark‚Äôs corpse, Peggy Gegenheim‚Äôs dog cemetery, tagliatelle, and gondoliers.</description>

      <description>The word ‚ÄúFahrrad‚Äù reminds me of King Fahd, of Saudi Arabia. But no. It‚Äôs not about that. Ein Fahrrad just means ‚Äúa bicycle.‚Äù And this long overdue blog post is about my bicycle, and what it‚Äôs like to use it around town. Woah. Calm down. You‚Äôre too excited.
Last fall I bought a used bicycle for ‚Ç¨170 from B7 Cycling Center, which hires former inmates and trains ‚Äòem as mechanics. The brand name, printed on my frame, says ‚ÄúHeavy Tool.</description>

      <description>Snow is falling in Linz today. This makes the kids very happy. I put on some ski gear and rode my bike to work along with dozens of other folks.
Snow fits the scenery. Linz is all in for Christmas. Lights are strung above the streets. Clear lights, globes, stars, and multi-colored spirals.
Linz has three different Christmas markets within a half mile radius. Main square‚Äôs market has tasty Gl√ºhwein. Volksgarten has classical music, animatronic elves, and a ferris wheel.</description>

      <description>We had special guests last weekend. Alison‚Äôs sister, Felice, and her friend Danielle. We poked around Linz together, and visited Salzburg for a day. It was fun.
Now that Felice and Danielle are back in sunny California we are back to our daily routine.
The routine looks like this. Wake up at 6. Make breakfast and lunch. Commute 25 minutes on a tram. Say goodbye to the kids. Have a cup of coffee as husband and wife.</description>

      <description>There are three supermarkets within a five minute bike ride of our flat. Two are in the local shopping center ‚Äî Merkur Markt, and Hofer. The third is Billa‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänext to Rudolphstra√üe station.
Merkur Markt has the most variety. You can find veggie dogs, sushi rolls, and lots of fresh produce. There are also giant home-made gummy bears. Big fan.
The Billa isn‚Äôt as nice as Merkur, but it works.</description>

      <description>We bought Max and Zoe smart phones in June. This was a huge deal for us. We were going to wait until Max was in high school. We relented. An obvious bribe. Compensation for the chaos of what followed.
Of course the phones are super useful‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially for translating and text messages. Maps are key too. I can see when they are at school, at home, or on a tram.</description>

      <description>We visited the Urfahraner market on Saturday. A market it isn‚Äôt. More like a county fair. We were joined by new friends. Thank God Alison is good at making them. Without her we‚Äôd be very bored. And thank goodness these befriended friends are fun. Incriminating evidence to follow.
The befriended friends come with kid-friends too. Fun to be had by the lot of us. Grown-up bunny-ear fun, and kid fun on the Autodrom (bumper cars).</description>

      <title>Some Light Reading in Linz</title>

      <description>Linz was Hitler‚Äôs favorite town. It‚Äôs where he started and where he wanted to end up. Austria‚Äôs largest concentration camp, Mathausen, is close by. That‚Äôs where the granite was quarried for the Nibelungen bridge. We see it every day.
We knew this about Linz. We talked about it before we moved here. Friends and family asked how that felt. They wondered if there is still anti-semitism here. It‚Äôs fine, we said.</description>

      <description>I am on a work trip this week. Four of us. Visiting a satellite office in Klagenfurt so I can meet the team and join some planning sessions. We took a train here, which lasted five hours and went through the alps ‚Äî but it was mostly dark and foggy. When the fog lifted, which happened a few times, I compared the countryside to places in America. The mountains look like the rockies ‚Äî big peaks and spires.</description>

      <description>We are ahead of ourselves. We want to be here in April 2020, not September. In April 2020 the kids will take the tram by themselves. They will have strong friendships. Alison and I will understand the healthcare system, and know enough German to order a sandwich without having to point.
But it‚Äôs September, not April. We‚Äôll have to wait for the sun and moon to come and go a hundred and fifty times.</description>

      <description>Lots of rap lyrics talk about benzos. Mercedes benzos. Nice cars. Just rented my second one from the Hertz in downtown Linz. A triple upgrade from the Ford Fiesta, but no rate change. Just ‚Ç¨32 a day. That‚Äôs how we roll. I rolled it all the way home.
We rent cars to transport things we can‚Äôt carry, and to get out of town. Driving around is pretty easy. The signs are a little different of course ‚Äî and there are no yellow lines ‚Äî only white.</description>

      <description>I can‚Äôt understand a word these people are saying. I do understand them on other levels. They stack wood like it‚Äôs an art form. I am sure I would do the same, if I had wood to stack. Their toilets have a little shelf so they can examine their poop. I have similar interests. They have a sensitive nose for mustard, which is my favorite condiment, and maybe my favorite food.</description>

      <description>The basics are in place. Kids have beds and bed frames. We do too. Everyone has a place to put their clothes. There is a dining room table with some temporary folding chairs. A desk in Zoe‚Äôs room and some bedside tables.
The bathroom has a new washer &amp;amp; dryer wedged between the sink and shower. They are supposed to stack, but they don‚Äôt stack very well, and this works‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least for now.</description>

      <guid>https://there-and-back.org/people/matt-reider/travel/phones/</guid>
      <description>We put new SIM cards in our phones. The carrier is Hofer Telecom. It‚Äôs a grocery store and a cell phone company. The plan is $10 a month for 15 gigs of data and unlimited calls. I am not sure which I enjoyed more‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfiring AT&amp;amp;T or Comcast. Cable Internet is $39 a month for 100 gigabits, by the way.
Now we have these weird (to us) phone numbers that start with +43‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Austrian country code.</description>

Tomorrow will be one week in Linz, Austria. We live in an apartment on Spazenhofstra√üe, a quiet street on the Postlingberg Tram line. Our building has five ground level apartments, each with two floors, and five balcony apartments along the top. The balcony apartment above us is occupied by Herig and Inga who looked down on us from the street as we waved hello.</description>
