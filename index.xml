      <description>Published by Every Day Press
After her husband died when their son was two, Deborah Green sometimes wrote down on random scraps of paper their boy&amp;rsquo;s words. These notes are the basis of the book, in which one can hear a young child&amp;rsquo;s voice after incomprehensible loss - and see his growth and affirmation.
