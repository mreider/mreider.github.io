      <description>Staring at the small film developing tank as an eight year old, trying to figure out the fractions of chemicals to make it all happen, I would never have guessed I would become a photographer. I preferred walking my dog on the beach near my home in San Francisco to studying Mathematics.
I married my high school boyfriend who became a psychiatrist and we had three children. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how I stumbled into photography.</description>

      <description>Summer vacation was a three-part trip. First was Long Island to celebrate Marty&amp;rsquo;s 80th birthday. Second was Vermont to join Rosie and Zach&amp;rsquo;s wedding. Then Portugal, with #friends4life Schwartzberg clan.
Coronavirus made it bumpy. The guest list for Marty&amp;rsquo;s birthday was shorter than planned. A particularly important guest, Alison, tested positive and spent the week feeling crappy, at the Stony Brook holiday Inn Express. It was a great party but not the same without her.</description>

      <description>Last week we took an American style road trip (üöô) through the Czech Republic. Originally we were thinking about Holland. Also Norway. But we procrastinated and airfares went up. So we decided to drive North.
On the road Like other vacations, this one started by dropping Leo (üê∂) at his second home - a beautiful kennel ranch outside of Linz.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an aerial view:
Nice place right? Leo agrees. He&amp;rsquo;s very waggy about it.</description>

      <description>I stopped writing over a year ago. Not sure why. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling it.
But today I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a short update.
We&amp;rsquo;ve experienced some new things. We went skiing on a couple of glaciers. We bought a hyperactive dog named Leo. We visited friends and family in America and then went scuba diving in Costa Rica. In autumn we saw Belgium, then climbed up the Eiffel Tower. Then it was winter again.</description>

      <title>One Boy by Deborah Green</title>
      <link>https://there-and-back.org/people/deb-green/oneboy/</link>

      <description>Published by Every Day Press After her husband died when their son was two, Deborah Green sometimes wrote down on random scraps of paper their boy&amp;rsquo;s words. These notes are the basis of the book, in which one can hear a young child&amp;rsquo;s voice after incomprehensible loss - and see his growth and affirmation.
